# marketview 0.3.0

## What's New:
* Updated to reflect the company re-brand:
    - Additional colours added to the palette
    - Added flextable_leaf() and flextable_black()
    - Updated ggplot themes to use Helvetica Neue fonts (the former theme_mvl() is available as theme_mvl_old())
    - create_project() now imports the new PowerPoint template (as well as the old template as mvl_template_old.pptx). It should work as per the old template, but the ordering oof some of the content might have changed in some slide masters, so just be sure to double-check that everything is added in the right order.

* Added source_dir() function to source all scripts in a directory (this has been added to the initialisation scripts in create_project())

## Updates
* Updated flextable_row_highlight() to be able to highlight particular cells, rather than entire rows only

## Updates
* Added more parameters to zoom_definition() - now possible to specify margins and the aspect ratio of the plot
* create_project() has had an overhaul:
  - results.R now loads processed_data.RData and gives a warning about the processing date, rather than sourcing the processing script when required
  - report.R is now created, for saving results directly as a powerpoint presentation via ReporteRs
  - creates a RUN SCRIPT which will run all the project scripts in sequence
  - imports mvl_template.pptx to the base directory for use with ReporteRs
  - output_archive is now moved to its own function, rather than ad-hoc code

# marketview 0.1.3

## What's New
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

## Bug Fixes
* `bounding_box()` works now, and added the option not to draw the border.
* `save_plot()` works, had a misnamed variable.

* removed the whitespace at the bottom of the plot in `theme_mvl()`
