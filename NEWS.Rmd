# Changes in version 0.1.3

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed ```bounding_box()``` and added the ```draw_border``` option to omit the plot border in a ```theme_map_minimal()``` plot.
* Fixed ```save_plot()``` - one of the inputs was misnamed.
* ```save_table()``` now cooerces ```x``` to ```data.frame``` first.
